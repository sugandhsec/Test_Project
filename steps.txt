step1: Open the shell in working project folder
step2: Import the required models in the shell Using Command

	from app_test.models import Building, RoomType, Room, BlockedDay

step3: Created a Building Object,Room Type Object and Room object and 
associated it with the Building and Room Type using command

	building = Building.objects.create(name='Building1')
	room_type = RoomType.objects.create(name='RoomType1', type='Single', building=building)
	room = Room.objects.create(number=101, room_type=room_type, price=2000.0)

step4: Created 20 Blocked Days and 10 Random Blocked days Using command



from app_test.models import Building, RoomType, Room, BlockedDay

building = Building.objects.create(name='Building1')
room_type = RoomType.objects.create(name='RoomType1', type='Single', building=building)
room = Room.objects.create(number=101, room_type=room_type, price=2000.0)
from datetime import date, timedelta

start_date1 = date(2022, 12, 1)
end_date1 = date(2022, 12, 10)

start_date2 = date(2022, 12, 20)
end_date2 = date(2022, 12, 30)

delta = timedelta(days=1)

while start_date1 <= end_date1:
    data1=BlockedDay.objects.create(day=start_date1, room=room)
    start_date1 += delta
    data1.save()
while start_date2 <= end_date2:
    data2=BlockedDay.objects.create(day=start_date2, room=room)
    start_date2 += delta
    data2.save()


    # block random days for any future dates
import random

today = date.today()

for i in range(10):
    random_date = today + timedelta(days=random.randint(1, 365))
    data3=BlockedDay.objects.create(day=random_date, room=room)
    data3.save()


To run test case run command in terminal where manage.py is located means in main folder
 python manage.py test
